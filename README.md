# Problems
I originally created this repo to keep track of my coding solutions when i was preparing for coding interviews. 

The items listed here will serve as a basic code questions that you should practice for a technical interview at just about any software company, including the giants: Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.

Along with code i have added few cheat sheets which might help you keep track of your concepts and tricks

Best of luck to you!


## Don't feel you aren't smart enough

- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.

 ## Pick One Language for the Interview

You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:

- C++
- Java
- Python


### Interview Prep

- [ ] [Programming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Through-Interview/dp/111941847X/)
    - answers in C++ and Java
    - this is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview
    - not too difficult, most problems may be easier than what you'll see in an interview (from what I've read)
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - answers in Java


### If you have tons of extra time:

Choose one:

- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews (C++ version)](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/)
- [ ] Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version)
    - [book](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517435803/)
    - [Companion Project - Method Stub and Test Cases for Every Problem in the Book](https://github.com/gardncl/elements-of-programming-interviews)


### Java

- [ ] [Algorithms (Sedgewick and Wayne)](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/)
    - videos with book content (and Sedgewick!) on coursera:
        - [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
        - [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)

OR:

- [ ] [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/)
    - by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
    - used as optional text for CS intro course at UC Berkeley
    - see my book report on the Python version below. This book covers the same topics.

### Python

- [ ] [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/)
    - by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
    - I loved this book. It covered everything and more.
    - Pythonic code
    - my glowing book report: https://startupnextdoor.com/book-report-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/
